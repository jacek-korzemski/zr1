# Recrutation app

The React One 🍪

## Running the app

Running the app is pretty standard. Just run:

`npm install` 🔧

Then rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill the file with valid API data. 📕

And of course, `npm start`. 🚀

## Testing

And, if you want to - `npm run test`, for basic components render tests. 🎷
